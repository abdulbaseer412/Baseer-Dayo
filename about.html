      <p>
        Hello! I’m <strong>Baseer</strong>, a student of <strong>MYP 4</strong> at 
        <strong>The International School, Karachi</strong>.
        I created this quiz website as part of my <strong>IB Personal Project</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The main goal of my project is to <strong>learn web development</strong> — 
        specifically using <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> — to design 
        a simple, user-friendly, and functional website. This website allows students 
        to test their knowledge in different subjects in an interactive way.
      </p>

      <p>
        My inspiration came from my deep interest in <strong>technology and design</strong>. 
        I’ve always been curious about how websites like YouTube and Google are made, 
        and this project gave me a chance to start learning those skills. 
        I also believe that technology is the future, and building digital tools can 
        help improve education for everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through this project, I learned not only how coding works but also how 
        creativity, logic, and design come together in real projects. 
        In the future, I plan to expand this website with more subjects, levels, 
        and interactive features — and eventually connect it to a database for real results.
      </p>

      <p class="highlight">
        This project reflects my journey as a learner — exploring coding, design, 
        and technology to create something meaningful for students.
